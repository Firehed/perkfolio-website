# Maximize Your Travel Card Points with Perkfolio

If you're a points-savvy traveler, you already know the power of your travel credit card.
Booking flights and hotels through your card's portal can unlock huge bonus multipliers - often 5x or more!

But managing all those loyalty numbers, perks, and special offers across airlines, hotels, and rental cars can be overwhelming.
Thatâ€™s where Perkfolio comes in.

## Why Travelers Benefit From Using Card Portals

Travel card booking portals are a goldmine for maximizing value:

- Get frequent flyer points or miles directly with your favorite airline
- Earn extra rewards on your card that you may not get booking directly with the airline
- Access to exclusive rates and discounts
- Sometimes even elite status perks when paired with your loyalty programs
- Maximize the benefit of travel protection from your card issuer

The downside?

You need to make sure every booking is tied to the right frequent flyer number, for everyone in your party (not to mention known traveler, for those with PreCheck or Global Entry).

Unlike booking directly with the airline, this data isn't known by your card issuer.
If you forget to add it, you'll miss out on valuable points and might not be able to skip the airport lines!

## How Perkfolio Makes It Effortless

Perkfolio is your travel companion app built for points collectors.
Instead of juggling spreadsheets, screenshots, or old email notes, Perkfolio keeps everything in one secure, private place:

- Store loyalty numbers for all your programs: airlines, hotels, rental cars, and more

- Organize everyone's info: multiple user support ensures you maximize rewards for yourself and all of your fellow travelers

## Real-World Example

When booking directly with the airline, a typical travel card will get you:

- Earn 2x card points per dollar
- Earn airline miles towards status and rewards 

Booking through your card's portal often gives drastically better results:

- Earn **5x** card points per dollar
- Earn airline miles _only if you add your frequent flyer number_
