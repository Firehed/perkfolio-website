# Frequently Asked Questions

## Features
### What is Perkfolio?

Perkfolio is an app for iOS that organizes all of your travel-related data: frequent flyer numbers, hotel and rental car loyalty programs, passports, and more.
With Perkfolio, you can store all of this information in one place and see everything you need when booking.

### Does Perkfolio support multiple people?

Yes, you can store travel data for multiple people.
The free plan is limited to 2 people.

### What data does Perkfolio store?

- Traveler names and birthdays
- Frequent flyer numbers
- Known traveler and redress numbers
- Passport information (number, country of issue, expiration, legal name)
- Hotel and rental car loyalty numbers

### Does Perkfolio know about airline alliances?

Yes.
Perkfolio knows about the three major airline alliances: OneWorld, SkyTeam, and Star Alliance.
We maintain and regularly update a list of what airlines are in which alliance (this changes more often than you'd think!).

When viewing your booking details, Perkfolio will automatically match FFNs from alliance partners if you're subscribed to the pro plan.

### How does Perkfolio compare to a spreadsheet/shared note/etc?

We created Perkfolio out of frustration with using a shared note to organize a couple dozen different loyalty programs!
Between syncing issues, not working well on a small screen, and spotty connections causing problems while traveling, we knew we could do better.

Compared to a spreadsheet, google doc, and everything else we tried, Perkfolio:

- Intelligently shows the information you care about when booking
- Displays frequent flyer info for alliance partners
- Shows passport expiration warnings
- Knows about nearly 100 frequent flyer, rental car, and hotel loyalty programs
- Works well offline and with poor network conditions

We think it's a much nicer experience overall.
Give it a try and let us know what you think.

### Does Perkfolio book travel for me?

Perkfolio helps organize and display all of your information relevant to booking travel, but doesn't actually book for you.
Maybe one day!

### Does Perkfolio sync data across my devices?

Yes, Perkfolio will automatically sync data across all of your devices, provided they are signed in to the same Apple Account.

### Does Perkfolio sync to my family's devices?

Perkfolio currently only syncs within a single Apple Account.
We are exploring family syncing in a way that's still secure.

### Does Perkfolio need internet access to work?

Perkfolio is designed to work without a network connection.

Syncing will be paused while you're offline and resume when your connection is restored.

### Does Perkfolio need iCloud to work?

No, but it will not sync across your devices without it.

## Pricing

Perkfolio is free to download, but some features require a paid subscription to access.

## Privacy and Security
### Is Perkfolio secure?

Yes.
All data within Perkfolio is stored encrypted on your device and synced across your devices using Apple's CloudKit services.
The team behind Perkfolio has decades of experience building software in regulated, security-audited industries like payments.

### Where is my data stored?

Data is stored encrypted on-device and, when available, encrypted in iCloud.
The physical location of iCloud servers may vary based on your device, Apple Account region, or other factors.

Perkfolio does not maintain our own servers for user data.
Analytics data maybe located in the US or EU, and does not contain any personal information.

### Can you see my data?

No.
Data in Perkfolio is stored encrypted on your device and in iCloud.

### What is End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)?

See [iCloud data security overview](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102651) for more information about E2EE and iCloud.

### Does Perkfolio use E2EE?

Perkfolio uses Apple's CloudKit services to store and sync your data.
By default, CloudKit encrypts data at rest and in transit.

Data stored in Perkfolio, along with other CloudKit data, is E2EE if you have enabled Advanced Data Protection.
See the link above for more information.

### Do you share my data?

No.
We do not even _have access_ to your data, so we couldn't even if we wanted to.

See [our privacy policy](/privacy) for details.

### Do I need to provide personally identifiable information (PII) to use Perkfolio?

No.
All data in Perkfolio is optional, and for your own use.
Perkfolio supports storing PII such as names, birthdays, and passport numbers.
If you want to skip it or make something up, that's fine with us.

### Do you use analytics?

Yes, we run _anonymous_ analytics on our website and in the app.
Our analytics **do not** collect any information about you, such as name, email, or IP address.

Basically, we just want to know what features people use and if everything is working well.

## Availability
### Is Perkfolio available worldwide?

Perkfolio is available for download in many regions and should work anywhere Apple devices do.
Results may vary underwater and in Outer Space.
